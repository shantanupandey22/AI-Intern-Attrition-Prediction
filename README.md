# AI-Powered Attrition Prediction System

## Overview
This project predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company (**attrition**) using the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset.  
It was developed as part of a technical assessment for the AI Intern role at **ABOSS Technologies**.

The solution includes:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Machine learning model training
- Model evaluation and visualizations
- Research brief on a recent AI trend (RAG)

## Dataset
Source: [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)  

Place the CSV file `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv` in the `data/` folder before running the notebook.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Understanding & Preprocessing
- Loaded dataset and explored structure
- Checked for missing values (none found)
- Encoded categorical variables with **OneHotEncoder**
- Scaled numerical features with **StandardScaler**
- Removed extreme outliers using IQR clipping

### 2. Model Building
- Algorithm: **Random Forest Classifier**
- Hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV**
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Visualizations: Attrition count, Age vs Monthly Income, Department-wise attrition rate, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve
- **Feature Importance** chart to understand key factors influencing attrition

### 3. Predictions
- Generated predictions for test set employees (Stay / Leave)
- Created results table with actual vs predicted labels

### 4. Research Brief
- Topic: **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Covers what it is, why it matters, use case, and challenges
